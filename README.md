STAT-490-Final- 
This is a project that I did as the final project requirement for my STAT 490 class at SIUE, which dealt with predictive analysis, big data, and machine learning.

The STAT 490 Project file is the original code I wrote for the project.

The STAT 490 Final Project RMarkdown is the R Markdown file for the project, organized in such a way that it follows my analysis of the dataset. The project description is given at the beginning of the file.

The kc_house_data is the dataset used for the project.

The STAT 490 Project Writeup is the final report I gave for the project. It gives an introduction to the dataset and follows my order of analysis of the dataset.

The STAT 490 Final Project Presentation is the presentation of the project I gave in front of the class.
